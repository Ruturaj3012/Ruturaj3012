Q3. How can I combine sales data from two different months, sales_january = np.array([300, 400]) and sales_february = np.array([500, 600])?
Answer:

1.Using np.concatenate():
code:
import numpy as np
sales_january = np.array([300, 400])
sales_february = np.array([500, 600])
combined_sales = np.concatenate((sales_january, sales_february))
print(combined_sales)

Output:
[300 400 500 600]

2.Using np.append():
Code:
import numpy as np
sales_january = np.array([300, 400])
sales_february = np.array([500, 600])
combined_sales = np.append(sales_january, sales_february)

print(combined_sales)

Output:
[300 400 500 600]
